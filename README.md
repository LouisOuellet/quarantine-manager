## Features
 - Simple interface
 - You can choose between 2 restorations methods. Resend or Copy. Resend will save the quarantined email in a .eml file and send it to the user's mailbox. While the copy method will simply create a copy of the quarantined email into the user's mailbox.
 - Restore or delete multiple emails at once.
 - Support for aliases. So 1 user can access the quarantined emails of multiple accounts.

## Why you might need it
Do you have a dedicated mailbox do save all the emails Amavis and Rspamd filters? How do you manage it? Wouldn't you want users to handle their own quarantine emails? Well this tool allows multiple users to manage the quarantine mailbox.

## Does it work with ISPConfig
Yes! This is actually why I wrote the application.

### Spam Policy example
See [Spam Policy](SPAMPOLICY.md).

## Can I use this?
If your email server is setup so that you have a dedicated mailbox for quarantined items, this project is for you.
